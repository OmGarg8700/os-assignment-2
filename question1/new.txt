DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) are a family of enzymes consisting of members DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b that mediate DNA methylation.

These members have different and integral roles to execute DNA methylation; DNMT1 is involved in the maintenance of methylation patterns while DNMT3a and DNMT3b are responsible for de novo methylation, that is, methylating DNA that is previously unmethylated [12].

DNA methylation signatures are developed during cell differentiation for the purpose of supressing genes with functions that are unnecessary to the mature cell.

 This de novo methylation is carried out by DNMT3a and DNMT3b [13].
After differentiation, DNMT1 replicates these methylation patterns in the process of mitosis 

Unstimulated cells express small amounts of DNMT1, but following mitogenic stimulation the enzyme is upregulated by a sequence of pathways including MAPK/ERK and JNK

DNMT1 is then able to maintain methylation patterns in the DNA by producing symmetrically methylated sites in parent and daughter DNA strands.
